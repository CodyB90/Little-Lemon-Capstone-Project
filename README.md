Here are the URL pathways to test out once you run the server:

'restaurant/' to view the static logo.

'api/menu/' to access the menu listing api where you can view and post anything to your liking for the given fields as long as the datatypes are appropriate.

'api/menu/<int:pk>' to look up a certain menu item based on their id where you can make updates or even delete from the list if you want.

'api/booking/' if you want to view or create any booking data on your browser api or insomnia or whatever rest client you're using.

'api-token-auth/' if you want to generate your own token using insomnia or some other rest client.

That's all! Let me know what you think once you tested the pathways and thanks again for the review!
